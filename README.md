# DeepLearning-in-BSDE
The interest in Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE in short) comes
from their connections with different mathematical fields, such as mathematical
finance, stochastic control, and partial differential equation. Since then BSDEs
have been widely used in stochastic control and especially in mathematical finance.
Any pricing problem by replication can be written in terms of linear BSDEs, or nonlinear
BSDEs when portfolios constraints are taken into account as in El Karoui,
Peng and Quenez. The key feature of backward stochastic differential
equations is the terminal condition that the solution must satisfy. These equations
are called forward-backward stochastic differential equations, if the randomness in
the terminal condition is coming from the state of a forward stochastic differential
equation.

In the past decade, there has been a tremendous advancement in the field of
artificial intelligence, thanks to deep learning which has helped mankind in every
field. Nowadays deep learning is an emerging and widely used technique in finance,
image recognition, natural language processing, healthcare and in many other
research fields.
Approximation methods based on deep learning are often a computationally fast
and efficient ways to solve nonlinear problems in option pricing.
The deep learning approximation method used in option pricing is due to the fact
that we can avoid assumptions about financial mechanics and learn from historical
data. In this fast-paced era, as much as speed is important for option pricing, the
offline training period of neural networks is a desirable property for this use.
